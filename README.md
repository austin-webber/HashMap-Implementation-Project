# HashMap-Implementation-Project
 Portfolio Project for CS261 - Data Structures at OSU

 Custom implementation of the HashMap data structure in Python using a dynamic array as the underlying storage.

 Collision resolution in the HashMap data structure is solved in two different ways:
 1. Chains of nodes with key/value pairs stored in singly linked lists.
 2. Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing.
